## An example of the process of the DES algorithm.

'The DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm is a symmetric-key block cipher created in the early 1970s by an IBM team and adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)... DES became the approved federal encryption standard in November 1976 and was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988, and 1999... DESâ€™s dominance came to an end in 2002, when the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) replaced the DES encryption algorithm as the accepted standard, following a public competition to find a replacement.'(Simplilearn)
